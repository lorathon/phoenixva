Hello <?php echo $user->name; ?>,

We received a request to transfer you to <?php echo $hub->get_full_name(); ?>.
If you made this request there is nothing more you need to do. The staff will
review your request and process it accordingly.

You can continue to fly while your transfer request is pending. You will be 
notified when your request is accepted or denied.

Please Note:
You can only have one active transfer request at a time. You will not be able to
request another transfer until your current request is accepted or denied.

Please contact your current crew center manager if you have any questions.

Thank you!
Phoenix Virtual Airways
